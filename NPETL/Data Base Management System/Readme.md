ABOUT THE COURSE :
Databases form the backbone of all major applications today – tightly or loosely coupled, intranet or internet based, financial, social, administrative, and so on. Structured Database Management Systems (DBMS) based on relational and other models have long formed the basis for such databases. Consequently, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase etc. have emerged as leading commercial systems while MySQL, PostgreSQL etc. lead in open source and free domain.

While DBMS’s differ in the details, they share a common set of models, design paradigms and a Structured Query Language (SQL). In this background the course examines data structures, file organizations, concepts and principles of DBMS’s, data analysis, database design, data modeling, database management, data & query optimization, and database implementation. More specifically, the course introduces relational data models; entity-relationship modeling, SQL, data normalization, and database design. Further it introduces query coding practices using MySQL (or any other open system) through various assignments. Design of simple multi-tier client / server architectures based and Web-based database applications is also introduced.

INTENDED AUDIENCE : Students from all disciplines can enroll for this course.
PRE-REQUISTES :1.	Procedural and / or Object-Oriented Programming (C / C++ / Java / Python)
				2.	Data Structures 
				3.	Algorithms
INDUSTRY SUPPORT : DBMS is so fundamental that all companies dealing with systems as well as application development (including web, IoT, embedded systems, data mining, machine learning) have a need for the same. These include – Microsoft, Samsung, Xerox, Yahoo, Google, IBM, TCS, Infosys, Amazon, Flipkart, etc.

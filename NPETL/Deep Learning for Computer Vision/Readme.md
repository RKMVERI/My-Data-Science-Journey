ABOUT THE COURSE :
The automatic analysis and understanding of images and videos, a field called Computer Vision, occupies significant importance in applications including security, healthcare, entertainment, mobility, etc. The recent success of deep learning methods has revolutionized the field of computer vision, making new developments increasingly closer to deployment that benefits end users. This course will introduce the students to traditional computer vision topics, before presenting deep learning methods for computer vision. The course will cover basics as well as recent advancements in these areas, which will help the student learn the basics as well as become proficient in applying these methods to real-world applications. The course assumes that the student has already completed a full course in machine learning, and some introduction to deep learning preferably, and will build on these topics focusing on computer vision.

INTENDED AUDIENCE : Senior undergraduate students + post-graduate students
PREREQUISITES :  
Completion of a basic course in Machine Learning
(Recommended, but not mandatory) Completion of a course in Deep Learning, or exposure to topics in neural networks
Knowledge of basics in probability, linear algebra, and calculus

CRITERIA TO GET A CERTIFICATE

Average assignment score = 25% of average of best 8 assignments out of the total 12 assignments given in the course.
Exam score = 75% of the proctored certification exam score out of 100

Final score = Average assignment score + Exam score

YOU WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR A CERTIFICATE ONLY IF AVERAGE ASSIGNMENT SCORE >=10/25 AND EXAM SCORE >= 30/75. If one of the 2 criteria is not met, you will not get the certificate even if the Final score >= 40/100.

Certificate will have your name, photograph and the score in the final exam with the breakup.It will have the logos of NPTEL and IIT Madras .It will be e-verifiable at nptel.ac.in/noc.

Only the e-certificate will be made available. Hard copies will not be dispatched.

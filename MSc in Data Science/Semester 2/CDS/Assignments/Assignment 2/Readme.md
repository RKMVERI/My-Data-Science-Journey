[15 marks] Write Python codes to verify that the compensated summation algorithm and the sorted sum, where at first the numbers are sorted using quicksort and then summed, are numerically equivalent algorithms. Compare the errors obtained in these two methods with the vanilla iterative summation method. [ Hint: generate an array of floating point numbers by first generating n random integers between a and b then adding an integer multiple of the machine epsilon to each number to make those floating point numbers. Vary n to see the effect on error]

1. Write Python codes of two line search algorithms: Fibonacci search and Golden Section for the
problem given in example 8.1.2 (same as in 8.1.3) in Nonlinear Programming, Bazaraa et al.
a. [10 marks] Generate and print the values given in Table 8.1 (for Golden section method) and Table 8.2 (for Fibonacci method) and check if you get the same results as in the book.
b. [5 marks] Check if the two search methods are asymptotically identical (run the code for 20 iterations and plot iteration number vs. interval length for the two methods)
c. [5 marks] Next use the scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar function and verify your results of Golden section method.

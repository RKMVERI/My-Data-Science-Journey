Assignmemt on regularised regression
Select a  dataset from the UCI dataset on regression (exclude categorical ovaribales for now). First inspect the predictors for multicolinearity and select  a subset which is linearly independent. Next find solution of linear regression model using normal equations  and sequential gradient descent (Widrow Hoff ). Next fit a LASSO and Ridge model using scipy.optimize library. Plot the solution pathh for different values of Î± using "lassopath" and "ridgepath" libraries of scipy. Compare the three models in terms of the solution obtained, prediction accuracy etc. Interpret the Lasso and Ridge solutions in terms of selection and shrinkage. Upload two files - one code and one pdf with the brief report. Deadline: 5 April 2022, 11.55pm

Assignment-4
Implement decision tree with the follows:
Create an artificial dataset (using our python tool) with a minimum of four classes and in each class, there will be at least twenty points.
Randomly divide the dataset into training, validation and test set as 2:1:1 
Consider three impurity measurements for your decision tree
Misclassification errors
Entropy
Gini entropy
So, have to build three decision trees, one for each impurity measurement
Calculate the training, validation and test accuracy for each impurity measurement and plot them
Finally, draw the decision boundary for each decision tree

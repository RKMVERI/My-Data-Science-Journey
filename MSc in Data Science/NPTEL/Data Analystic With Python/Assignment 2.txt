'''
At first the definitions of mutually exclusive events and independent events may sound similar to you. The biggest difference between the two types of events is that mutually exclusive basically means that if one event happens, then the other events cannot happen.

Mutually exclusive and independent events

On the other hand, if the events are independent, then it means the occurrence and the outcome of any one event wonâ€™t have any effect on the occurrence and outcome of the other events.
